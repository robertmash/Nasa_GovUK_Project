## First data science project
- Focusing on cleaning and visulisation using R. 
- Uses data from Nasa and GOV.uk 
- Visualise trends and statistics based of climate change, and rates of stops and searches throughout my investigation
- I find that In 2017, we can denote that black people were up to 8 times more likely to be stopped in comparison to white people. This is similar with the Asian population who are increasingly more likely to be stopped over white individuals. I didn't include the "Other" variable as it was missing some data, which wouldnt add any impact to the conclusion.
